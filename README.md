# Maglev-Stimulation-Control-Design
# This Project is for Final Project of 2023 Fall EECS460 Continuous System Analysis Design.
# This project is to design a PLD controller to control simulation of Maglev's linearized and nonlinearized system. 
# We built the PLD controller using MATLAB SIMULINK and tested in the lab. 
# In the Lab Report, we analyzed the output data and evaluated performance of the controller.

# The project follows the University of Michigan Academic Integrity.
